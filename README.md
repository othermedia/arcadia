Arcadia
=======

Arcadia is a full-width image gallery written in JavaScript.


Todo
----

* Stop timed rotations when any other control is clicked.
* Add slider support to the thumbnail area.


Dependencies
------------

Running the test suite requires the [JSON gem][json], as well as [Jake][jake].
To get them just run the following command (with `sudo` if you prefer).

    gem install json jake

The gallery itself relies on [Ojay][ojay] (and therefore [YUI][yui] and
[JS.Class][jsclass]), as well as two other libraries: [Edgecase][edgecase] and
[Scaling Slider][slider].
